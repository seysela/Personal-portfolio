            </h2>
            <p>My name is Seysela Chann-Hong. I am currently a student at Kennesaw State University as an IT major. I am first generation student as my family immigrated from Cambodia. 
                With a vibrant array of hobbies, I find joy in exploring various creative outlets that keep me engaged and fulfilled. From the intricate strokes of a pencil to the rhythmic flow of yarn in crocheting, and the delicious aromas that fill the kitchen when I'm cooking, each hobby adds its own unique flavor to my life. These pursuits not only fuel my creativity but also serve as a testament to my passion for embracing new experiences and honing my skills.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>  My aspirations extend beyond the realm of hobbies, however, as I harbor a keen interest in the world of gaming and content creation. 
                The allure of becoming a streamer for the popular game Valorant ignites my ambition, driving me to immerse myself in the gaming community and cultivate a platform where I can share my passion and connect with fellow enthusiasts. 
                As an IT major, I am equipped with the technical know-how to navigate the digital landscape, laying the groundwork for a future where I can seamlessly blend my love for gaming with my professional expertise.
            </p>
            <br>
               <p> At the heart of my pursuits lies a deep-seated desire to contribute to the gaming industry in a meaningful way, particularly through a role at Riot Games. As a company renowned for its innovative approach and commitment to fostering a vibrant gaming community, Riot Games embodies the ethos that resonates with my own values and aspirations. With a blend of determination, kindness, and empathy, I approach each endeavor with a steadfast resolve, eager to make a positive impact and carve out a path that merges my passions with my professional aspirations.
